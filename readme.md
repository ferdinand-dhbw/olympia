# Athletes
## UML
The UML diagram can be found in the root and UML directory.

## Hint
All added events and athletes are saved in an internal serialized file. <p>
Try to add an event / athlete and then restart the program.
After once again choosing a data base, you will be asked if you want to load the unsaved changes.

For exporting the athletes as a data base click _Save_.
